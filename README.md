# PopSim
Population Microsimulation: This Python program takes a baseline number of individuals and simulates their number of descendants across time given different demographic parameters such as probability of conception, probability of miscarriage, average postpartum infertility, etc. It's most useful for simulating natural fertility populations, but can easily be modified to take into account contraceptive probabilities.
